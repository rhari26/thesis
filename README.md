In this technology era, most software developers and enterprises are bound to
use open-source software components to reduce the eorts of development. Which
also says 96% of the applications used in enterprises are built through open-source
software. These OSS components are shared with the help of portals like GitHub
and GitLab. The main strength of the OSS component, which is highly shareable
and reusable, will be the biggest weakness. Due to its rising IT security threats, the
security part is still being improved from the beginning of \shared code culture".
An unsecured OSS component may lead to huge security threads.
In this thesis, we are building an OSS vulnerability scanning web application to
extract and analyze the OSS component used inside software projects. At the same
time, the scanning takes place on the client-side due to the source code privacy of
the user's software project. Our OSS scanner can scan most of the known software
projects and it is also built by considering the scalability of the software projects.
Finally the extracted components will be analysed to nd the known vulnerability
with the help of vulnerability databases.
