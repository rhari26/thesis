This chapter will explain about the scanner architecture, things that have considered while designing the component and some of the useful techniques I have analyzed to make an efficient scanner to extract \acs{OSS} component.

\subsection{Scanner Architecture}
 The first task of developing this scanner is creating an automated \acs{OSS} component extractor because manual extraction of \acs{OSS} component is a tedious and redundant task, finding a automated system will reduce the time consumption and makes more cost effective. The manual \acs{OSS} extraction is suitable for small projects with less \acs{OSS} components consumption which is a very rare case.
