My work shows a direction for further development and research in the domain of open-source software security. I have developed a scanner that extracts the \acs{OSS} components from software projects with the help dependency managers. There are numerous
possibilities to improve or customize this scanner according to the application scenario.
\paragraph{}
The extracted \acs{OSS} component from the software projects can be used for creating a license clearing tool. The license clearing tool is another important process in an organization so that the organization can maintain transparency towards the usage of a software.If the license is properly maintained then the organization can avoid unwanted cost.
\paragraph{}
Apart from automating the extraction of \acs{OSS} components and delivering the vulnerability information of each \acs{OSS} component, we can also develop an extra feature like recommending the nearest version with less vulnerability of the same component. In this case the user can have an idea of nearest version of the component.
\paragraph{}

There could be many other ways in which the scanner can be improved, other than the ones pointed out by me. However, I believe that the scanner so far has yielded satisfactory results as is evident from the evaluation. I hope to see more improvements in this scanner, or in general, in the field of open-source software security.
