\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
This chapter explains how the component is developed. The ways to overcome the design challenges, some of the findings during the development have been written down.

\subsection{System Characteristics}
When beginning the implementation, I decided to use a simple yet powerful programming language for both frontend and backend applications to obtain my results. The programing languages which I selected was javascript for frontend and C\# for the backend. To simplify my programming work, I used the Visual Studio Code IDE for the frontend and Visual Studio 2019 for the backend. The configuration of the computer used for implementation is as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item [$\bullet$]Operating System: Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 - 64-bit
	\item [$\bullet$]Processor: Intel Core i7-6700 @ 3.4GHz
	\item [$\bullet$]RAM: 16GB
	\item [$\bullet$]HDD: 500GB
\end{description}

The software support tools used for frontend implementation are listed as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item [$\bullet$]Programming Language: Javascript
	\item [$\bullet$]IDE: Visual Studio Code
	\item [$\bullet$]Packet Manager: npm
	\item [$\bullet$]Version Control: Azure Repos
\end{description}

The software support tools used for backend implementation are listed as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item [$\bullet$]Programming Language: C\#
	\item [$\bullet$]IDE: Visual Studio 2019
	\item [$\bullet$]Packet Manager: NuGet
	\item [$\bullet$]Database: Azure Data Storage - Containers
	\item [$\bullet$]Version Control: Azure Repos
\end{description}

All the infrastructure and software that I used are provided by evosoft GmbH.
