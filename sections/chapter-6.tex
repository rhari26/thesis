In this chapter, I summarize the results obtained from my experiments. My experiment is mainly focused with open-source software discovery and finding the suitable vulnerability database for vulnerability analysis.

\subsection{Open-Source Software Discovery}
As defined previously, the scanner has to scan \acs{OSS} components from different application framework projects. This means that the scanner should have function which as to give a common output even if it scans different project. In this experiment, first I have tried using manual scrapping to understand how the \acs{OSS} components can be identified and where it is registered inside the project. The manual scrapping will be an easy solution if it is a small project but it will be a time consuming process if it is performed in a large scale project. Figure ~\ref{fig:laravel}, ~\ref{fig:ruby}, ~\ref{fig:gradle}, ~\ref{fig:django}, ~\ref{fig:pom} and ~\ref{fig:dotnet} shows where exactly the OSS components are registered in the project. From these files with the help of manual scrapping, we can extract the component name and version by traditional copy \& pasting technique. Then we have to search vulnerability information of each component in the vulnerability database.
